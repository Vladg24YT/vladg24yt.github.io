# About
Hi, I'm Vladislav Gorsky, also known as Vlad The Mountain or Vladg24YT. I'm a beginner self-taught coder in Java and Lua. I'm writing either development-related or gaming-related Java apps and Lua programs for OpenComputers as a hobby. Sometimes I translate apps.

## My Projects
- [**Fibonacci Sequence calculator (`C++`)**](https://github.com/Vladg24YT/Fibonacci-Sequence-calculator)
  - This one was created for a school project. It counts the first 93 numbers of the sequence and allows to do basic manipulations with them.
- [**Game of Life (`Lua`)**](https://github.com/Vladg24YT/Game-Of-Life)
  - A Lua implementation of Conway's Game of Life for OpenComputers Minecraft mod

## My Finished Translations
- [Modelbench Russian translation](https://github.com/Nimikita/Modelbench/pull/1)
- Sketchware Russian translation (Top #2 as of June 2020, but requires total recreation due to several skipped major app updates)
