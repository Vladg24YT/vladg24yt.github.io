# About
Hi, I'm Vladislav Gorsky, also known as Vlad The Mountain or Vladg24YT. I'm a beginner coder in `Java 8` and `Lua 5.2`. Coding is my main free-time hobby.

## My Finished Projects
- [**Fibonacci Sequence calculator (`C++`)**](https://github.com/Vladg24YT/Fibonacci-Sequence-calculator)
  - This one was created for a school project. It counts the first 93 numbers of the sequence and allows to do basic manipulations with them.
- [**Conway's Game of Life (`Lua`)**](https://github.com/Vladg24YT/Game-Of-Life)
  - An implementation of Game of Life for OpenComputers Minecraft mod

## My Finished Translations

- Sketchware Russian translation (Top #2 as of June 2020, but requires total recreation due to several skipped major app updates)
